## Overview
This is a flask web app which predicts the first inning score of Indian Premier League(IPL) with the help of Rgeressor model. The dataset is taken from https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor credits to Shivam Mitra. It contains the score made on each ball of the matches played in IPL from 2008 to 2017.

## Motivation
Since childhood I am a great cricket fan. I played cricket at district and state level. Unfortunately 2020 is not a great year for all of us. We can't go outside from our home and enjoy the outdoor games. Last Year, I have started learning Data Science and Machine Learning course from online platform. So I thought to utilize this lockdown period to build something for a cricket fans using AI/ML. It is just a small initiative towards this.
